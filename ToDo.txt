CLI
- add config caps for missing USB settings (serial, vid, pid ...)
- PARTIALY: add functionality to issue HIDScripts
	- run async scripts
	- proper job management and cancelation
	- retrieve log output of scripts

BOOT
- deploy a default boot payload (Post Run in systemd service ??, config via /etc/P4wnP1/settings)

USB
- DONE: add functionality to fetch target devices for HID (e.g. keyboard could be at /dev/hidg0..n depending on USB config)
- init HIDController

HID
- add additional keyboard layouts (not for first release)
- DONE: fix absolute mouse movement
- DONE: avoid memory leak on reinit of HIDController
- DONE: implement job management

- DONE: blocking JavaScript to go callbacks (waitLED, delay, waitLEDRepeated) have to consume the otto.Otto.Interrupt channel
to be able to be aborted when Otto is interrupted

WIFI
- implement connection to OPEN-AUTH network as STA
- implement nexmon firmware support (not for first release)

TO FIX:
- debug out of HIDScript puts way to much CPU load on journaling daemon (floods logs)
